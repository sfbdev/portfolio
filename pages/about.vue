          to help me with various tasks on my Discord Server. I am also learning

          web-development skills.

          I started learning about web-development in my early high-school,
          where I was introduced to HTML and CSS. I quickly started writing
          small webpages with simple HTML and little of CSS. After my
          high-school, I took some time to myself and explored the web
          development world more and found many frameworks. Out of all, I found
          my love for Vue.js. Since then, I've been mastering it, and with every
          new project I added a new tool, like TailwindCSS, Express and more.
